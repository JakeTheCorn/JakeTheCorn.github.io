We do the smallest possible thing and measure its effects, if any.  We find ways of getting faster and faster feedback.

If requirements are bad, there is nothing wrong with working on the requirement development process... however, the one thing we can't

We can assume we are wrong, go ahead and build a minimal thing, measure its outcomes and then we're actually
much further along than if we'd allowed ourselves to get stuck in analysis.

And... more importantly, our experimenting can begin.
