I just wanted to leave a few of the notes from this great video from Woody Zuill and Lewellyn Falco.

[Practical Refactoring - How to clean code in many small steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWiwDdx_rdo&ab_channel=LlewellynFalco)


## Refactoring
***(do the following in order)***

<hr />

* Remove Clutter -- Remove Anything in the code that has no value
    * Format Code
    * Remove Comments
    * Remove Dead Code
    * Remove Unnecessary code

* Remove Complexity
    * Bad Names
    * Long Methods
    * Deep Conditionals
    * Magic Numbers/Strings
    * Improper Variable Scoping
    * Missing Encapsulation
    * Obscure Code Blocks

* Remove Cleverness
    * Cryptic Code
    * Abbreviated Code
    * Hijacked Methods - methods that have been modified beyond their original intent/design

* Remove Duplication

Some quotes I like about refactoring.

  > Refactoring is held to a higher standard -- don't give business as reason to say 'no refactoring' -- Jay Bazuzi

  > "Good" is the enemy of "slightly less terrible" -- Arlo Benshee
