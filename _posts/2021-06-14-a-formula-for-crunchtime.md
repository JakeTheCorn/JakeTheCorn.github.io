# IT'S CRUNCH TIME

<!-- here explain the symptoms and madness -->

# What to do?

## Identify the Core Stakeholders
<!-- these are the people who need to be alerted -->

## Assess current state
<!-- figure out where we are and what kind of effort needs to occur to push this across the finish line -->

## Identify the Requirements - (The Functional ones...)

<!-- here talk about behavioral changes needing to be prioritized much higher than structural ones -->

## De-scope!
<!-- general overview about descoping -->
### De-Scope the Behavioral Changes

<!-- De-scope to the core use case -->

### De-Scope the data
<!-- if the data is particularly vast, solve for the bell curve, the most common data -->

## Optimize the Feedback Loop
<!-- One will not be able to go fast unless changes can be easily and quickly verified -->
