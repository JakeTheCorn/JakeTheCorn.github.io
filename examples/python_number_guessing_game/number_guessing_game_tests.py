    TODO:
        √ It writes a welcome message before the game begins
            √ Make writer arg in Game ctor keyword only
            √ Make writer attr in Game appear as non-public
        √ It writes a message asking the player to guess a number between 1 and 10
            √ Revisit the tests knowing about order of writer calls
            √ DRY common test arrage/setup steps
            √ put expectation on left side of assertEqual
            √ use mock.call() instead of call() to make meaningful distinction in calling code
